Project Name: Modular Java Microlearning Course Platform on Replit
Version: 1.0
Date: [Insert Date]

1. Purpose

To develop an interactive, browser-based platform for teaching Java programming through modular microlearning courses hosted on Replit. The platform will utilize LangChain to automate content delivery, provide feedback, and create a seamless learning experience for developers.

2. Objectives
	•	Deliver modular, self-paced Java lessons accessible entirely through a browser.
	•	Automate testing and feedback for learners’ code submissions.
	•	Enable course creators to design, deploy, and manage learning modules with ease.
	•	Provide learners with an engaging and interactive environment for practical coding exercises.

3. Key Features

3.1 Course Content
	•	Modular Structure:
Each course is divided into concise, self-contained modules focusing on specific Java concepts (e.g., loops, conditionals, OOP, etc.).
	•	Interactive Prompts:
LangChain-powered content delivery with clear explanations, code snippets, and exercises.
	•	Practical Exercises:
Each module includes a coding task where learners can write, run, and test their solutions.

3.2 Automated Testing and Feedback
	•	Unit Tests:
Predefined test cases evaluate the correctness of learners’ solutions using Java testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit).
	•	Immediate Feedback:
Feedback is displayed directly in the Replit interface, highlighting successes and areas for improvement.
	•	Custom Evaluation Criteria:
Support for customized test conditions to align with course objectives.

3.3 LangChain Integration
	•	Prompt Templates:
LangChain handles the dynamic generation of explanations, exercises, and hints based on course creator input.
	•	Sequential Learning Path:
LangChain ensures learners progress logically through the course, with dependencies between modules enforced.

3.4 Collaborative Features
	•	Real-Time Collaboration:
Replit’s multiplayer feature enables live coding sessions between learners and instructors.
	•	Forkable Templates:
Learners can fork lesson Repls to create their own working copies while maintaining access to the original template.

3.5 Scalability
	•	Designed to support multiple simultaneous learners.
	•	Optimized to handle varying levels of complexity in exercises and solutions.

4. Target Audience
	•	Primary: Organizations and teams seeking to upskill developers in Java.
	•	Secondary: Independent learners interested in hands-on Java programming.

5. User Stories

5.1 Course Creators
	•	As a course creator, I want to use LangChain to generate modular content so that I can quickly design and deploy lessons.
	•	As a course creator, I want to define custom test cases so that I can evaluate learner submissions effectively.

5.2 Learners
	•	As a learner, I want to interact with practical exercises so that I can immediately apply new concepts.
	•	As a learner, I want to receive instant feedback on my code so that I can learn from mistakes in real time.

6. Functional Requirements

6.1 Platform Requirements
	•	Hosted entirely on Replit.
	•	Supports Java development and execution.

6.2 LangChain Integration
	•	Ability to generate interactive prompts dynamically.
	•	Sequential logic to guide learners through dependent modules.

6.3 Testing Framework
	•	Automated unit testing with JUnit or equivalent.
	•	Customizable feedback based on test results.

7. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Accessibility: Fully browser-based, requiring no local installations.
	•	Performance: Ensure seamless operation for multiple users without lag or delays.
	•	Scalability: Designed to handle increasing numbers of learners and more complex courses.

8. Milestones

Milestone	Description	Timeline
Project Kickoff	Define scope, set up Replit workspace	Week 1
Content Development	Create modular Java lessons with exercises	Weeks 2-4
LangChain Integration	Build dynamic content delivery system	Weeks 5-6
Automated Testing Setup	Implement JUnit-based testing and feedback	Week 7
Beta Testing and Feedback	Launch beta with selected learners and iterate	Week 8
Final Deployment	Deploy full course for all users	Week 9

9. Risks and Assumptions
	•	Risk: LangChain may not natively support specific course features; requires custom implementation.
	•	Assumption: Replit’s infrastructure will remain stable and support required integrations.

10. Budget
	•	Replit: Free tier for initial development, consider upgrading for team collaboration.
	•	LangChain: Open source, but additional costs may apply for scaling or hosting.

11. Metrics for Success
	•	Learner completion rates for individual modules.
	•	Accuracy of automated feedback and test results.
	•	Positive learner and course creator feedback.
